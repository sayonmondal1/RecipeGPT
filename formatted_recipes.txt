The leaves and bark can also be used to treat whooping cough, ordinary coughs, and chronic bronchitis.

Peach bark is still used to improve blood flow and eliminate blood stagnation caused by amenorrhea, dysmenorrhea, postpartum abdominal pain, and pain and swelling due to external injuries.",

"Put jar in an undisturbed place; as the solution cools, crystals will form on the pipe cleaner.", "The longer you soak it, the more crystals you will have and the less the original pipe cleaner will show through, so adjust time until you achieve your desired look -- overnight will give you very thick crystals, a few hours will give you just a gentle glittery look.", "Remove from solution and let dry.", "Spray with clear acrylic if desired.")

Recipe: c("Your chili paste will use whatever kinds and heat-scale of chiles that you like.  The paste I make, my own self, uses mostly ancho chiles, a large, juicy, dark purple pod that came from in New Mexico on Earth That Was.  I like the mild heat and smoky flavor.  The guajillo peppers are good for that, too.  Sometimes I add some chipotle or cascabel , or  for extra heat.  Other folks who like Earth That Was Chinese often use tien tsin peppers, or for Indian use sanaam or dundicuts.  Of course, the fun part is coming up with your own combination that's perfect for you.",

My own self, I wear the gloves.", "Let's do this thing!  Go ahead and weigh out 6 ounces of your choice of dried chiles.  Remove the stems and all the seeds and discard them.",

Let 'em soak for 30 minutes.", "Drain the water from the chiles (you can keep the water and use it with your noodles, iffen you like).", "Find the food processor or food mill in the galley and put the soaked chiles in there, then purée them thoroughly.  If you use a processor, press the resulting puree through a sieve to get a totally smooth paste.  If you use a mill, it'll come out as a smooth paste from that.  You'll have about 1 1/2 cups of chili paste.", 
"Get yourself a clean jar with a tight lid that's large enough and put the paste into it, then pour some vegetable oil over so that there's a couple of centimeters oil on top of the paste.  The oil helps preserve the paste and it'll keep several months in the fridge this way.  Without the oil, it'll keep for about 14 days.", "There, now you've got yourself your own Heat.

Recipe: c("Select the best brisket by wiggling the brisket back and forth@ the middle of the point end.  This will tell you how fatty the point cut is, and how much fat layer there is between the point and flat cut.  The easier it wiggles, the better.  Buy the cheapest grade you can get.  We want as little marbling as possible.  Be sure you have a whole \"packer trim\" brisket, and not a flat cut or point cut.  12-13# is optimum for this application.", "1-2 days before, rub brisket well with rub, and wrap tightly with H.D. plastic wrap, place in pan and refrigerate, or place in ice chest.", 
"The day of the cook, start early by moving the brisket out of the fridge and packing it with black pepper.", "Prepare your fire for the smoker, and, on a separate grill, prepare a VERY hot fire for searing the brisket.", "When smoker is up to temp(250*-275*) sear brisket thoroughly on all sides and ends as well.  We're talking so black that it looks like it's ruined, but don't worry, it's not.  While it's OK to pierce the meat with a fork 2 this point, it's preferable not to.  You may need help turning it w/ tongs.", 
"Once seared, place brisket in foil pan, fat side up, and smoke, uncovered for 2 hours.", "Flip brisket and smoke for 1 hour.  At this point, the juices inside are under a fair amount of pressure.  It is important not to pierce the meat from this point until it is done.", "Flip brisket back to fat side up, and cover with foil.", "Continue to smoke until internal temperature of 200* is obtained.  There will come a point where the temp won't go up no matter what you do.  This is normal.  Resist the temptation to kick up the temp in your smoker. Time remaining to achieve 200* should be 5-9 hours.  The reason for such a large variable is that smoker temps are not precise, and amount of \"open time\" will vary from cook to cook.", 
"When 200* is obtained, remove from smoker, and allow to cool until it is safe to handle, then carefully lift brisket out and remove to a cutting board, and tent w/ foil.  A long spatula, or some other long support will be helpful, because it will probably try to break up on you.  Run pan juices through a grease separator, and freeze smoky grease in ice cube trays for baked bean seasoning (folks that've never had beans that way will be in awe).  Reserve pan juice to serve over brisket.", "Once cooled enough, separate the point from the flat.  There will be a fairly easy to follow fat layer separating the two.  Just gently slide a knife through the fat and lift and pull the point away as you cut.  If you accidentally cut into the meat, it's no tragedy, just back up a little, and go at it again.", 
"Once separated, slice the point cross grain, trimming off excess fat as you go. You will likely find several slices that are too fatty to serve, or maybe some of the outer shell that's too dry to serve.  Reserve this meat, chop it fine, freeze, and save for baked bean seasoning.", "If you look at the flat, you will see that the grain of the meat changes direction about in the middle of the cut.

Close the lid and wait until the wood chis are smoking.  Put the \"rib cage\" spit on the rotisserie of your grill.  Half close the lid, I use a wrench as a spacer).  Turn off the bottom burners, turn on the rotisserie motor. Try to regulate the temperature to about 230F, by adjusting the lid's opening, and the back burner's temperature (low to medium low). Let it spin for 4-5 hours, until the meat has shrunken away from the bone a bit and they are drop-dead tender and mouthwatering, then cut them free from the cage and enjoy.", 
"If you are one of those \"wet\" rib eaters, you can sauce them on your plate or start basting them 30 minutes before removing from the grill, and every 10 minutes until ready.")

This sudsing agent is in anything that \"bubbles\" (soap, hair shampoo, bubble bath, toothpaste and some foods)  This product, in it's commercial form is used to de-grease airplanes.  In it's pure form, it will burn the skin.  So, when looking for products, check the ingredients and usually SLS is the second ingredient.  There are liquid soaps on the market that do not have this ingredient and they are better for sensitive skin.  Look in health foods stores or there are a lot of companies that sell this product on line", 
"- Tea Tree Essential Oil has numerous (wonderful) properties for healing troubled skin.  I always carry this when I travel for any cuts or scrapes.  I would use caution where applying this eso.  This could burn very sensitive skin.  Dilute it with some olive oil before applying or do a patch test first.", "-  The No-Seems are tiny bugs that are in the sand.  I get multiple bites on my feet and ankles that can take up to 6 weeks to heal. My feet and ankles can swell up to another shoe size.  For these nasty critters, I found a homeopathic pill that helps with the bug bites.  I take this pill 3 days before I travel.  It is called Ledum Palustre. (you can find them in health food stores)  Afer taking this pill, the bugs stay away and I have minimal bites.  I highly recommend these and they have become \"holiday\" savors for me!"

I find a 9\"x13\" baking pan works great.  Make sure your pan is at least an inch deep.", "Take ham out of wrapper and rinse it with cool water if you think it feels icky.  Then find the plastic doohickey on the large cut end and remove it. At this point you can trim off some of the fat if you would like.  I usually don't, as most of it renders out into the pan or is very easy to cut around.", 
"Place ham in pan with large cut side down.", "Stab with the business end of a probe style thermometer.  This is the kind which has a long metal skewer on one end (the business end), a long cable, and a box which has all the controls and readouts.  Make sure the probe goes through a large area of meat, not fat, and doesn't hit one of the bones down the center of the ham.  Set your thermometer to alert you when the ham reaches 140°F.", "When your oven has reached 350F, put the ham in (be careful, it's heavy).", 
"Wait until the thermometer alerts you.  Then remove the ham from the oven (remember, it's heavy and now it's really hot, too).  Remove the probe, and either start slicing or put on a pretty platter and let your family/guests ooh and ahh. :).", "NOTE: The skin gets very black and crispy.  Do not panic, the meat is juicy, I promise.  Simply cut the skin off where it is really crispy and get to the meat underneath.", "ALSO: If you do not have a probe style meat thermometer, or need an idea of timing for preparing the rest of your meal, an already cooked (city) ham will reheat to 140F in approximately 15 minutes per pound.  So a 12 pound ham will take 3 hours.  Ish.", 
"And FINALLY: I like to carve off the leftovers and separate into 1 pound amounts.  I then put these into labeled quart sized freezer bags and freeze for casseroles, pasta, or beans another night.  The bone can be put into a labeled gallon sized freezer bag, and then thawed for yummy beans another night.")

Then make a horizontal slice to make 12 servings. Use a sharp knife dipped in warm water for clean cuts.", 
"TIPS:.", "TO soften sorbet, place it in a microwave-safe bowl and microwave on HIGH until softened, about 30 seconds.", "Sticky packaging is a sign that sherbet has probably thawed, leaked and then refrozen.

When ready to serve, let the cake stand at room temp for about 10 minutes to make slicing easier.", "For a delicious and elegant presentation, serve each slice in a pool of fresh fruit sauce, such as strawberry or raspberry, and garnish with a sprig of fresh mint.",

Recipe: c("Culture the cream:  pour cream into a container, cover and let sit at room temperature for 2-3 days.", "The cream will seperate some, and will sour.  This is a good thing!", "Stir the cream to reincorporate the ingredients.", "Begin to slowly whip the cream, by hand or using a stand-mixer.", "When soft peaks begin to form whip faster.", "The butter fat will begin to seperate from the butter milk -- continue to whip until you have pea sized chunks of the butter fat clinging to the side of the bowl.  This step may take some time, but be patient, it will happen!", 
"Line a collander or strainer with cheesecloth and place your butter fat / butter milk into the cheesecloth (make sure to catch the butter milk!  you can use it for pancakes later!).", "Pull the ends of the cheese cloth together and press down to get rid of more of the butter milk.", "You should now have a large hunk of very soft butter -- it's still got some butter milk incorporated into it, so --", "You now want to rinse the butter under cold running water to remove more of the butter milk -- I do it a small handfull at a time, and I do it over a strainer or collander so I don't lose any small pieces.  It takes some practice, but you'll get the hang of it quickly.", 
"After you've rinsed all the butter,  place it in a mixing bowl and begin to press it up against the side of the bowl using a flat spoon or rubber spatula.  You'll release more butter milk and water this way, so make sure to drain that off as you go.", "This is also the step where you will add any 'special' ingredients i.e. salt, lavender, honey, whatever -- I prefer to make it un-salted, but recipezaar won't let me post a recipe with only one ingredient, so I'm listing salt --", "when you're done with this step place the butter in some kind of mold (I use a cake pan lined with cheesecloth) and place it in the fridge.", 
"after a few hours the butter will have set and if you want to cut it into smaller pieces you can do so --", "This is an incredibly simplified version of the recipe that I use to make the butter that we sell at the shop I work at -- I make approximately double this recipe every week.  It's easy and, actually, kind of fun.  The end product will be much smoother and fresher than any butter you would buy at the store (unless, of course, you're shopping where I work :) .)", "Starting with a better product will, of course, yield a better result.  I suggest using raw, organic, unpasteurized cream, if you can get it.  You will be pleasantly surprised with the result, and you will be doing your body, and the local economy, a favor.", 
"A note about culturing -- you can omit this step if you like, but I reccomend trying it at least once.  I think if you do, you'll never go back.  It gives butter a characteristic flavor and a little more 'zing.'  I often have customers questioning this step saying things like \"So you just let the milk go BAD?  Isn't that un-healthy?\"  I usually try to calm them by pointing out that this has been done for centuries with much success.", "A note about temperature -- you will find it very difficult to do this recipe in a hot kitchen.  The butter will melt constantly and you'll lose more in the rinsing process.  At the same time, a cold kitchen will make it difficult as well.  I find that 70 to 75 degrees is the ideal temperature."

Recipe: c("Obtaining Smoked Rib MOJO:", "Start by building a fire in the lower compartment of your smoker. See below if you only have a regular charcoal grill. I use charcoal to build the initial fire.", "While you are waiting on the coals to grey, you can prepare the smoked ribs by coating them them mustard on both sides. Use a lot. This will be messy so do it near the kitchen sink. Don't worry about ruining your barbequed ribs because the mustard will cook off during the process. Use a large cookie sheet to prepare them on. Next, sprinkle the ribs with whatever rub you like. If you do not have a rib rub, then just use your favorite combination of spices. Set aside or refrigerate if your fire is going to be a while. There is a myth that you need to peel away the fatty film from the underside of the rack of ribs but I don't see the point of this as there isn't any meat on that side.", 
"Make sure that you have the necessary wood for good smoked ribs. It takes several hours for the ribs to smoke so you may need several pieces of wood. I prefer the natural kind, but you can buy wood chunks at most grocery stores if you do not have access to wood.", ".if you are using a normal charcoal grill : Build your fire to one far side of the grill and cut it off from the rest of the grill with a stack of bricks or foil.", "Remember we are not wanting to cook the ribs yet, but rather smoke them. So, try to rig it so that as little heat gets to the meat as possible (the meat is going to go on the other side of the grill; as far as possible from the flame). I use a stack of bricks to separate the fire from the meat. I have the bricks with the holes in them so it works well to let the smoke through without so much heat. I then rig a double-piece of aluminum to use above the rack level to cut off the heat from the fire section to the meat section.", 
"Okay, slap those ribs on the racks and feed the fire some of those twigs or sticks. Close most air valves in your smoker. leaving only a crack. just enough to keep the fire alive (ideally only as smoke). Obviously, keep the lid down. Let those smoke for about 3 to 6 hours, depending on how much meat you have on. Add wood as necessary and turn ribs half way through. If you have multiple levels of racks then it helps to switch the slabs from one to the other so you get an even smoke distribution.", 
"Remember, try to NOT let the ribs cook. They may brown a bit but we don't want them bone-dry. Shield them with foil if necessary.", "Next step: bring inside and allow to cool. Double wrap each whole slab in foil. Refrigerate overnight to allow the smoke to set into the meat.", "______________________________________________.", "Cooking Instructions: Leave smoked rib racks in foil. Eash rack should be wrapped individually.  Put on cookie sheet or in large pan. Put in oven at 255 degrees. Again, do NOT remove foil or else you will ruin it.

Recipe: c("Vintage vs. Non-Vintage Champagne:  All Champagnes are made from grapes grown in France's northeastern region, the Champagne province. Most Champagnes are non-vintage: that is, they are made from a blend of grapes from different years, aged in the bottle for 18 months. Vintage Champagne is made with high-quality grapes from the same year; they must be aged three years before they are released.", "Champagnes from Dry to Sweet:  In addition to classifying Champagne as vintage or non-vintage, 6 classifications are used to refer directly to the Champagne's sweetness:", 
"Brut: dry, less than 1.5% sugar.", "Extra Sec: extra dry, 1.2 to 2% sugar.", "Sec: medium sweet, 1.7 to 3.5% sugar.", "Demi-Sec: sweet, 3.3 to 5% sugar (Served as a dessert champagne).", "Doux: very sweet, over 5% sugar (Served as a dessert champagne).", "Other Wines with Bubbles:  Sparkling wines made by the same process can't be called Champagne unless they're made in their namesake French region. Chardonnay and pinot noir grapes are the main varieties used to make Champagne, and they're grown all over the world; many regions produce fine sparkling wines that are somewhat less expensive and more widely available than French Champagne. Italian Prosecco and Asti, Spanish Cava and German Sekt are all delicious varieties of sparkling wine.", 
"As a side note: the small clusters of grapes sold in the supermarket as \"champagne grapes\" are just using the cachet of the name: they're actually fresh zante currants.", "Serving Champagne:  Chill the wine in the coldest part of your refrigerator. Open the bottle by twisting off the wire cage over the cork, keeping your thumb over the cork. Keep the bottle at an angle, with the cork pointing away from you. Grasp the neck of the bottle with a dry cloth; with your thumb over the cork, gently twist the bottle. You should feel the cork easing itself loose. Don't go for the dramatic pop: removing the cork should be almost soundless.", 
"Serve Champagne in clean, dry flutes--narrow glasses with tall sides--which show off the color and the fine bubbles while keeping the carbonation from dissipating. \"Prime\" the glasses by pouring a small amount of wine into the bottom of each glass, letting the foam subside before filling them fully.")

Cut your tofu in half lengthwise.  Place it between paper towels or clean dish towels and press gently (hard enough to get some of the moisture out but not hard enough to squish it).  Cut into about 16 triangles or strips.", "Add the tofu pieces to the pan.  Leave plenty of room around each piece (you might want to cook it in two batches).  Cook VERY SLOWLY over LOW TO MEDIUM heat.  Slow cooking is the key to ensuring the tofu doesn't stick to the pan and that the water has time to evaporate so that the tofu can brown.  Do NOT use oil.  What you want to do is leach all the water out of your tofu in a dry pan.  As the tofu cooks, frequently use a spatula to press down on the top of each piece.  You should see some water squeezing out and sizzling in the pan.", 
"When the bottom sides are firm and golden, carefully flip the pieces and repeat the same process on the other sides.  They are done when they are firm and golden on both sides.", "Now that your tofu has given up most of its water, it is perfectly ready to soak up any marinade like a sponge.  Place the cooked tofu pieces in your marinade of choice, stir, and let sit for about half an hour.  Now your tofu is ready to eat or to use in a stir-fry!", "Uncooked leftover tofu should be placed in a container that has a lid, submerged in water, sealed, and stored in the fridge.  Try to remember to change the water every day or two until you use it.  Cooked tofu can be stored like any other leftovers."

Immediately scrub with hot soapy water and harsh scouring pad. Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care. Scrub vigorously both inside and out, then rinse and wipe dry. Immediately season your pan.", "Initial Seasoning: rub 2 tbsp cooking oil over the entire surface of the pan. Place over medium heat for about 10 minute Using a paper towel, distribute the oil over the inside of the pan while it is heating. Tilt the pan over the burner so that the sides of the pan heat as well as the bottom. Caution - the pan is hot, handle with care. Remove the pan from the heat and cool. Repeat 3-4 times. Your pan is now seasoned and ready to use.", 
"Basic Care: wash with hot water only (no soap) and immediately dry thoroughly. Soaps or detergents will remove the seasoning. Remove burned food with a scouring pad and hot water. Apply a light film of cooking oil before storing to prevent rusting. If you use soap to clean your pan, simply follow the initial seasoning instructions to restore to protective finish. If your pan becomes rusted, simply scour and re-season. A well-seasoned pan will naturally darken with use. Do not leave food in pan after cooking. Do not wash in dishwasher."

The Zaar wouldn't let me submit the recipe with just one ingredient, so I just put down \"water\" because it wouldn't alter the nutrition facts, and there will be some residual water in the freezing and thawing processes.", "TOOLS YOU NEED: safety goggles, a very sharp knife that can handle tough foods, a cutting board, a mini food chopper or a standard food processor, and freezer bags. I use gallon-size Hefty One-Zips. OPTIONAL- Allergan tear drops or other natural tears, rubber gloves.", 
"If you have a food processor, you can probably chop all the onions at once. Me, I use the mini food chopper for this. It looks like a tiny version of a food processor with a blade that rotates. You can pick them up for $10-15 at most department stores, a very nifty must-have for urban foodies with limited space and budgets who lack a dishwasher. Safety goggles are also integral because though you may look silly doing this, it's worth it to avoid that horrid burning pain. Swim goggles also work in a pinch! Onto the process:", 
"Put on the goggles to prevent getting eye burn.", "Lay the onions out on the cutting board. With the sharp knife, cut the ends off of each onion and peel each one. This step can be a pain, which is why the rubber gloves are an optional tool because if you have cuts on your hands the onion can burn.", "If you use a strong food processor, you can just throw the peeled onions in and pulse until they are chopped to the consistency you like. Store in the freezer bags, making sure you label it with the date you packed it. I use a gallon size bag for this amount of onions, sometimes two gallon-size bags.", 
"Use the tear drops in case the goggles slip or you feel any burning after cleanup!", "If you use the mini food chopper, cut the onions into pieces that will fit in the chopper's cup, then pulse until chopped, and repeat until you use up all the onion pieces, spooning the chopped onion out into the freezer bags.", "If you're cooking with onions the same or next day, put some aside (see next step for amounts.).", "When a recipe calls for a \"small onion\", I use 1/4 cup. If it calls for a \"regular\" onion, 1/3 cup. \"Large\" onion = 1/2 cup. Otherwise, just follow what the recipe says for the amount of chopped onion if they give you an actual measurement.", 
"FOR FUTURE USE AFTER FROZEN: Simply open the freezer bag and measure out what you need with the cups or spoons. You may need to add just a wee bit extra to make up for frost crystals taking up space. You can thaw it out over a couple hours or overnight, but I prefer to microwave for about 30 seconds then blot off the excess frost and water.", "The onion usually lasts indefinitely once frozen, but I find that after about 6-7 months it starts to lose potency from freezerburn.

Finally, top evenly with grated cheese.", "Bake for 1 minute only. Turn the oven off. Leave in the oven overnight.The hot oven melts and browns the cheese, producing an even coating of crisp brown cheese. The fat from the cheese soaks inot the crackers and puffs them slightly. Leaving them in the oven dries them out well so that they are super crunchy. Break apart and eat or store. They keep well for several weeks sealed in an airtight tin.", 
"Note:  From The Oregonian:  The basic method, which we cribbed from an old recipe called Rooster's Famous Fire Crackers, calls for placing a layer of saltines on a baking sheet, sprinkling it with shredded cheese and spices, and baking briefly in a super-hot oven.  The cheese melts, then crisps up as it cools. The spices -- any blend of you can dream up -- give it zing, and the results are addictive.  After falling in love with Fire Crackers, we couldn't stop there.  We tried different cheeses -- some mellow, some sharp -- and different spices, from barbecue rubs to lemon-dill.  After lots of testing, we found a handful of great combinations, such as Smoky Cheddar and Barbecue, and Lemony Parmesan and Red Pepper. Don't wait for a party to try them.", 
"Note:  Here are a few tips to remember as you make these snacks at home:", "• Use any type of saltine cracker you like.", "• Finely shred the cheese using the small holes on the grater, so it melts into a uniform layer.", "• Don't be afraid to improvise; any kind of cheese/herb combo is fair game, though we especially like spice blends combining some heat and a bit of sweetness.", "Fire Cracker variations:", "Make these versions using the accompanying basic recipe for Rooster's Famous Fire Crackers, or use them to inspire your own creations.",

Recipe: c("A food processor with a cutting blade is your best friend for this job. Empty half the package of cookies into the processor and turn it on. As the cookies break down, add the other half through the top. Process until they are a fine texture like coarse corn meal. Lumps or cookie chunks are not your friend, either remove them or keep processing until all is fine.", "Next, add the cream cheese. This is one time that you DO NOT want the cream cheese to be soften. The colder the better. Process the cream cheese and cookies until they're well mixed. You will not have a solid dough, but it will be tacky and easy to form into balls. If by chance the dough is too soft, then semi-flatten the dough into a medium size bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes.",

"After you have all the balls rolled, slide the sheet pan into the freezer for 5 to 10 minutes. While they're firming up a bit, start working on melting the chocolate coating. You'll need about 3/4 of the package of almond bark plus approximately 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. The chocolate chips are to add a milk chocolate color to the coating. Careful not to go too heavy on the chocolate chips, they can cause the coating to be soft and lose that chocolate snap you want around the creamy center.", 
"To melt the almond bark & chocolate chips.", "Use a metal or glass bowl that fits snug over a small pan, but where the bottom of the bowl will not touch the water in the pan.", "Bring one cup of water to a simmer in a small pan, do not let the water boil. You need the low heat to melt the chocolate, not the steam. Chop the almond bark into the same size pieces as the chocolate chips, so they can all melt evenly. Put them both plus 2 teaspoons shortening in bowl and place over pan. It will take 1-2 minutes to fully melt, so do not walk away.", 
"When you see the chips starting to melt, get a spatula and gently stir the chocolate. Do not over stir, just move the chips around to help them melt. When you see there's just a few chips left, turn off heat. Add another teaspoon of shortening if the coating seems too thick. Go get the cookie truffles from the freezer.", "Using the same pan, push all the balls to one side and make room for chocolate dipped balls. With a fork or dipping tool, place one ball in melted chocolate and quickly coat evenly. Lift up ball and gently shake extra chocolate off. Flip coated ball back onto sheet pan. Get another dough ball and repeat steps until all are coated. Now it's time to decorate.", 
"To make the decorative squiggle on the top.", "In a small microwaveable bowl, melt 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips or peanut butter chips with 1/2 teaspoon of shortening, on 70% power for 1 minute. Then again at 70% power, 30 second intervals until melted, stirring between intervals. Continuous stirring helps melt any remaining lumps.", "To make a piping bag: Place one bottom corner of a 1 quart freezer bag down into a drinking glass and fold the top of the bag over the rim of the glass. Scrape the melted chocolate into the bag with a spatula. Lift up the freezer bag and twist it right above the melted chocolate, squeezing out the air. With a pair of good scissors, snip a TINY corner off the bag. With a firm even grip, start squeezing and squiggling across the chocolates.",

Recipe: "This recipe is so simple and easy and tastes so delicious. I use the cryovac Kansas City style pork rib slabs, but any style would work except boneless pork ribs. With those you would need some kind of rack in the bottom of your crock pot so they don't rest in the accumulation of fat and juices while cooking. Rub the rack of ribs with your favorite dry rub. If you don't have a favorite, you can make a quick dry rub with seasoned salt, pepper, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder and onion powder (or any combination of those). You can do a marinate over night, but I like the way the dry rubs taste. For easier clean up use a crock pot liner. Place the ribs in the crock standing on their side. No need to add any liquid. Cook on low for 8 or more hours, or on high for 5 hours. The ribs are done when you see them pulling away from the bone. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Remove the ribs carefully from the crockpot and place on a flat pan, meaty side up. Brush or pour on and spread BBQ sauce, as much or as little as you like. Cook in oven for 10-15 minutes, just long enough to carmelize the sugars in the sauce. Remove from oven, slice into servings. Serve with potato salad, ranch beans, pickles and onions. Yummy!"

Recipe: c("Place the chocolate candy melts in a small microwave-safe bowl.  Microwave on high in increments of 30 seconds, stirring in between, until the chocolate is completely melted.  Allow the chocolate to cool for a few minutes before using as it is easier to work with chocolate that is slightly thickened.", "Cut off the tops of the strawberries and reserve the tops (these will be used for the wattles).  Place a strawberry in the bowl of melted chocolate and stir it around with a spoon until it is completely coated.  Lift the strawberry up out of the chocolate and allow some of the excess to fall off.  Place the strawberry onto wax paper.  Repeat with the remaining strawberries.", 
"Assemble the \"eyes\".  Place two pearl candies side-by-side on the top part of the \"face\" of the turkey and hold them there for a few seconds, until they stay on their own.  Dip the tip of a toothpick in the melted chocolate and dot the center of the pearl candies with the chocolate to complete the eyes.  Repeat with the remaining strawberries.", "Make the \"feet\".  Place two orange candy hearts at the bottom where feet would go and hold them there for a few seconds, until they stay on their own.  Repeat with the remaining strawberries.", 
"Make the \"beak\".  Take 6 pieces of the candy corn and cut the yellow and white parts off, so you have just the orange portion remaining.  Cut each orange piece into a triangular shape.  Dip the tip of a toothpick in the melted chocolate and apply some of the melted chocolate to the backside of a \"beak\".  Place the beak onto the strawberry under the eyes and hold it there for a few seconds, until it stays on its own.  Repeat with the remaining \"beaks\".", "Make the \"wattle\".  Using a sharp paring knife, cut very thin slivers off of the reserved strawberry tops.  Drape the strawberry sliver over the beak and gently press it into the chocolate.  Repeat with the remaining \"wattles\".", 
"Place the turkeys in the freezer for 5 minutes, to allow the chocolate to slightly set.  Allowing the chocolate to slightly set at this point helps the candy corn (feathers) stick to the chocolate and strawberry easier.", "Make the \"feathers\".  This is the hardest part but after a little practice, it really is easy.  6 total pieces of candy corn go into the top of each strawberry to make the \"feathers\", 4 on the top and 1 on each side.  With your toothpick, poke four small holes in the very top edge of the strawberry where the 4 top candy corn would go.  Gently and carefully press the pieces of candy corn into the holes.  I find that this is easiest if you steady the strawberry with your other hand by placing the toothpick in the backside of it as you press the candy corn pieces inches  For the remaining 2 side \"feathers\", you must cut the candy corn at an angle to make them fit more easily into the sides.  Make small holes with the toothpick for the side \"feathers\" and press the candy pieces in as you did with the others.  Roll your toothpick around into the melted chocolate and spread a thin layer of the chocolate at the base of the \"feathers\".  This will give some extra support for the candy corn.  Hold the candy corn in place for a few moments, until they stay on their own.", 
"Return the turkeys to the freezer for 15 to 20 minutes, to allow the chocolate to completely set.", "Enjoy!")

Recipe: c("Place the pork tenderloin in a slow cooker; pour the root beer over the meat. Cover and cook on low until well cooked and the pork shreds easily, 6 to 7 hours. Note: the actual length of time may vary according to individual slow cooker. Drain well. Stir in barbecue sauce. Serve over hamburger buns.", "My Note:   Here's the deal folks! Most would agree that using a pork tenderloin for pulled pork is not a good idea. Cheaper cuts of pork work just the same and have tons of flavor! I used a 4 pound shoulder cut (also called Boston butt). It was only $5, whereas a 2 pound cut of tenderloin was $10! I cooked in the slow cooker for 7 hours, pulled it apart and mixed with Sweet Baby Ray's Hot and Spicy sauce, and then cooked for another hour. I served them on Kaiser rolls with coleslaw and homemade fries.", 
"I followed the recipe only adding a couple of things. Before placing the tenderloin in the slow cooker, I rubber salt, pepper, and garlic salt on it. I then used a fork to poke holes in the tenderloin so the juices could be soaked up. I added the root beer and let it cook on low for 5 1/2-6 hours. I then drained and pulled the pork apart easily with a fork. I returned the pork to the slow cooker and added the BBQ sauce and let it continue to cook on low for another 1-1 1/2 hours.", "I tweaked this reciped just a bit and the result was really good! I knew a 2 lb tenderloin would never be enough for my family of 6, so on the advice of the butcher at my grocery store, I used a 4 lb shoulder (it had a small bone in it, but it slid out easily after cooking on low for 10 hours. I mixed 1/2 cup of Bull's Eye Original Barbeque sauce with 2 cups of root beer then poured it over the roast, sprinkled it with a generous amount of dried minced onion, then drizzled some additional barbeque sauce over the roast. Halfway through cooking, I turned the roast over, added more minced onions and another drizzle of sauce. After 10 hours in the crock, I removed the roast, let cool slightly and then shredded it. I mixed in the rest of the barbeque sauce, some salt and a little water to moisten it and served it on a bun. The result was a restuarant quality pulled pork sandwich that my whole family enjoyed!", 
"Sometime I used a 6 pound pork shoulder and filled up my slow cooker with root beer to cover the meat. Left it in for about 10 hours. It was so tender and juicy, I could barely take it out of the slow cooker! The best thing is--7 pounds of pork shoulder was only about $10! The means you can make enough pulled pork sandwiches to feed about 30 people for about $15-20! And they will be raving about it and ask for the recipe too!")

With a metal spoon, carefully spoon the whole yolk of each egg into each of the two recesses. Whisk the white of the eggs lightly with a fork to break them up a bit and then spoon as much white around the yolks as your recess will hold. Do not overfill or your sandwich will leak. You may well have some egg white left over; as a guide, I can get about 1.5 egg whites in my toaster.", 
"Gently place the second slice of bread on top (oiled side up) and bring the lid down slowly so that it rests on the sandwich. (Do not squash it or attempt to lock the toaster shut at this stage). Leave in this position for 2 minutes. Then, slowly close and lock the lid, and cook for a further 3 minutes.

Recipe: c("-  For this recipe I used a 6-qt crock pot that comes equipped with a meat thermometer that plugs into the unit and provides continuous monitoring of the meat temperature.  (See \"BACKGROUND\" below for further explanation.)  I also used a metal oval cooking rack that fits perfectly into the crock pot which raises the roast up and keeps it from sitting in the liquid at the bottom of the pot.  To simplify cleaning I also used a disposable slow cooker liner.", "- BACKGROUND:  We have been using crock pots to cook beef and pork roasts for more than 40 years.  We would always follow the recommended cooking times of 8 to 12 hours on LOW heat.  (I believe the instructions for today's newer crock pots have lowered the recommended cooking time down to about 6 to 10 hours.)  But the roast always turned out tough and dried out regardless of how much spice, sauces, and liquids were added or not added to the meat.  We now know this long duration cooking just removed all the meat's nutrients and natural flavors.  This is why they all came out tasting about the same with that proverbial \"crock pot flavor/aftertaste\".  So we invested in a crock pot that has an attached meat thermometer which continuously monitors the meat temperature then shuts the cooker off when the correct temperature is reached.  This way you are not always removing the lid to use a hand-held meat thermometer which also adds to the cooking time due to the loss of heat, or so says the owner's manual.  Now back to the cooking instructions.", 
"-  Place the roast on the cooking rack and pour the 13 ounces (1 1/3 cups) of pre-packaged slow-cooker sauce of your choice over the meat.  In this recipe I used a 2.5 pound boneless pork loin center cut.", "-  Place the lid on the crock pot and insert the attached meat thermometer through the access hole in the lid into the thickest part of the roast and turn the heat onto LOW.", "-  This particular crock pot took 2 hours and 45 minutes to raise the meat’s internal temperature from 32 degrees to 140 degrees.  Upon reaching 135 to 140 degrees immediately remove the roast and wrap it in aluminum foil and allow it to rest for 15 to 30 minutes.  The meat will continue to cook and redistribute its nutrients and natural flavors.  (If you use a hand-held meat thermometer when you first remove the roast from the slow cooker you will see the smaller end pieces are already past 145 degrees.  Serve these sections to your guests who like their meat well done and dried out.).", 
"- Now remove the metal cooking rack from the crock pot but leave it on LOW in order to keep the sauce at the bottom hot.", "- Skim off any fat that may be floating on top of the sauce and then stir it up.", "-  Slice the roast to the thickness desired and spoon the sauce over the slices.", "-  Now ENJOY!")

Keep in mind the longer you work with a single batch the darker the color will become, so when initially mixing, keep that in mind."
